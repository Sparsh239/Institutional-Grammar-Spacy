facilities or lake(s) from entering public waters. 
G. 
An application for issuance or renewal of an aquaculture permit may be denied in its entirety or 
limited as to species authorized to be kept if necessary to protect Colorado's wildlife resources or 
cultured aquatic stock from a negative impact such as: 
1. 
Potential habitat competition, damage or destruction; 
2. 
Disruption of migration, breeding, or rearing and survival of young; 
3. 
Predation; 
4. 
Danger to humans, domestic livestock or property; or

Commissioner to enforce these regulations at any reasonable time. A permittee shall make records 
required by these regulations available to such authorized Department or Division employees during 
regular business hours.  
VI. 
RECORD KEEPING 
A. 
All aquaculture facility permittees shall maintain records documenting the acquisition of aquatic 
organisms. The records must show the name and address of the business or person from whom 
such aquatic organisms were obtained, their date of acquisition, and their species, number and 
size. The permittee shall retain all records for the period of ownership of the aquatic organisms 
and for three (3) years after disposition.

STATEMENTS OF BASIS, SPECIFIC STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND 
PURPOSE 
A. 
March 30, 1992 – Effective April 30, 1992 
The Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority and Purpose for this rulemaking activity is no longer 
in the Department’s files. 
B. 
February 17, 1998 – Effective April 30, 1998 
These rules are adopted pursuant to 35-24.5-105(1) and 35-24.5-106(1).

These recommended changes are the result of a review of the existing regulation by the Colorado 
Aquaculture Board. This review resulted in both technical and operational changes being recommended. 
C. 
May 13, 2008 – Effective June 30, 2008 
Statutory Authority 
These amendments to these rules are proposed for adoption by the Commissioner of the Colorado 
Department of Agriculture (“CDA”) pursuant to his authority under the Aquaculture Act (the “Act”), §35-
24.5-107(1)(a),(c), and 5, C.R.S. 
Purpose 
The purpose of these proposed rules is to: 
1. 
Require all fish in Colorado aquaculture holding and aquaculture production facilities to be 
certified as Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (“VHS”)-free in accordance to Colorado Division of 
Wildlife Chapter 0 Regulations. 
2. 
Reduce the aquaculture facility permit fee from $150.00 to $100.00. 
3. 
Correct several typographical errors, delete obsolete language, and to add a section to contain 
the statements of basis, specific statutory authority and purpose. 
Factual and Policy Issues 
The factual and policy issues encountered when developing these rules include: 
1. 
Rule III(A) currently requires all production facilities that sell or stock live salmonids to obtain an 
annual fish health inspection. In March of 2008 the Colorado Division of Wildlife expanded its 
Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (“VHS”)-free certification requirements for salmonids to include 
testing for all species of fish. The requirement applies to all in-state aquaculture holding and 
aquaculture production facilities and is intended to maintain Colorado’s VHS-free status. CDA 
proposes to amend Rule III(A) to expand the VHS-free certificate carrying requirement to all fish 
in Colorado aquaculture holding and aquaculture production facilities. 
2. 
Section 35-24.5-106(1)(a), C.R.S. allows for the Colorado Aquaculture Board to consider and 
recommend to the Commissioner rules concerning fees to fund all direct and indirect costs of the 
administration and enforcement of the Act. CDA recommends a reduction in the aquaculture 
facility permit yearly fee from $150.00 to $100.00 because the current level of administration of 
the program would remain intact, and there would be a reduction in cost to the aquaculture 
industry. 
3. 
After review of these Rules, the Aquaculture Board found three typographical errors that needed 
to be corrected and, if these amendments are passed, an obsolete sentence that needs to be 
struck from the Rules.

This copy of the text of the “Rules Pertaining to the Administration  and Enforcement of the Colorado 
Aquaculture Act“ is provided as a convenience to the public by the Colorado Department of Agriculture and 
does not constitute an official publication of these Rules. The official version of these Rules is published by the 
Office of the Secretary of State in the Colorado Code of Regulations at 8 CCR 1201-21 and may be obtained 
from the following website: http://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/Welcome.do. 
 
The amendments to these rules are proposed to the Commissioner of the Colorado Department of 
Agriculture (“Commissioner”) for his adoption pursuant to his authority under the Aquaculture Act (the 
“Act”), § 35-24.5-107(1) and (5), C.R.S. 
The purpose of these proposed rules is to: 
1. 
Define “aquaculture facility permit” to comport with the current definition as codified within the 
Aquaculture Act, § 35-24.5-103(2), C.R.S. 
2. 
Define the common, biological term “Gamete(s)” as it specifically relates to fish and aquaculture. 
3. 
Clarify aquaculture facility permitting requirements for the following groups of persons in the 
following ways: 
a. 
To articulate that a broker who never physically possesses a live fish or viable gamete 
does not need a permit; 
b. 
To create an exemption for those persons who sell live fish to individuals from grocery 
stores, fish markets, and restaurants, but to maintain the requirement that those who 
transport live fish to these types of outlets must have a permit; 
c. 
To distinguish bait dealers who propagate, transport, or release live fish or viable 
gametes into state waters from those who do not such that only bait dealers who 
propagate, transport, or release live fish or viable gametes into state waters need a 
permit. Those who do not undertake these specified activities do not need such a permit 
as long as they obtain their live fish and viable gametes from a Division fish health 
certified source, maintain records of fish acquisition, and provide their customers receipts 
for sale of live fish and viable gametes; 
d. 
To maintain the exemption from requiring a permit for those who hold live fish or viable 
gametes in closed aquaria or backyard ponds, including those facilities that are 
municipal, state, or federal facilities or any accredited zoological garden; and 
e. 
To clarify that persons transporting live fish or viable gametes that have been legally 
obtained for a non-commercial, personal use in aquaria or backyard ponds or as bait do 
not need a permit. 
4. 
To articulate and clarify the results of non-compliance with the provisions of the rule and to allow 
the Commissioner to set the time limit for disposal of live fish and viable gametes in the event that 
a permit is denied, suspended, or revoked. 
5. 
To establish record-keeping requirements of bait dealers who are exempt from the permitting 
requirements of the Aquaculture Act. 
6. 
To move this rule within the Code of Colorado Regulations from the Markets Division (8 CCR 
1204-7) to the Animal Industry Division (8 CCR 1201-21) to reflect a reorganization of the 
Aquaculture Act to the Animals Division within the Colorado Department of Agriculture. 
7. 
To make general changes to language within the rule to ensure consistency with the newly 
proposed definitions, exemptions, and other changes.

Office of the Secretary of State in the Colorado Code of Regulations at 8 CCR 1201-21 and may be obtained 
from the following website: http://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/Welcome.do. 
 
Factual and policy issues 
The factual policy issues encountered when developing these rules include: 
1. 
The definitions of the rule are changed to provide more consistent, clear language to define that a 
permit is for an aquaculture facility as defined within the Aquaculture Act, § 35-24.5-101, et seq. 
2. 
Section II.A is expanded to define more clearly who does and who does not need a permit 
pursuant to the Aquaculture Act. The previous definition broadly stated that no aquaculturist could 
engage in the described acts without a permit. The proposed language articulates five 
exemptions from permitting based upon a variety of factors, thus more clearly guiding the public. 
3. 
Throughout the rule, changes in language are incorporated to clarify intent, remove obsolete 
provisions, and to bring the rule as a whole into conformity with the newly proposed parts. 
E. 
February 15, 2013 – Effective March 30, 2013 
Statutory Authority 
The amendments to these rules are proposed to the Commissioner of the Colorado Department of 
Agriculture (“Commissioner”) for his adoption pursuant to his authority under the Aquaculture Act (the 
“Act”), § 35-24.5-107(1) and (1)(c), C.R.S. 
The purpose of these proposed rules is to: 
1. 
Define “aquatic organism” to comport with the current definition as codified within the Aquaculture 
Act, § 35-24.5-103(5), C.R.S. 
2. 
Change language throughout the rule to conform terms to the new definition of “aquatic organism” 
and removal of the term “gamete.” 
3. 
Define “Division” to comport with its new name, the Division of Parks and Wildlife. 
4. 
Change language throughout the rule to conform terms to the new definition of “Division” and 
removal of any references to the non-existent Division of Wildlife. 
5. 
Introduce new structure to the rules to provide ease of comprehension and application without 
modifying any current requirements or limitations. 
6. 
Provide a registration process for bait dealers who are exempt from the aquaculture facility 
permitting process to ensure that the Department properly records them as bait dealers and thus 
exempt from permitting requirements. 
Factual and policy issues 
The factual policy issues encountered when developing these rules include: 
1. 
The Department continues to attempt to make these rules easier to read and more effective. The 
use of “aquatic organism” allowed the Department to simplify the rule to get rid of “live fish and 
viable gametes,” characterizing this group, generally, as “aquatic organisms.” Similarly, the 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This copy of the text of the “Rules Pertaining to the Administration  and Enforcement of the Colorado 
Aquaculture Act“ is provided as a convenience to the public by the Colorado Department of Agriculture and 
does not constitute an official publication of these Rules. The official version of these Rules is published by the 
Office of the Secretary of State in the Colorado Code of Regulations at 8 CCR 1201-21 and may be obtained 
from the following website: http://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/Welcome.do. 
 
Department had to change the reference to Division of Wildlife to match its new name, Division of 
Parks and Wildlife. 
2. 
Throughout the rule, the Department has used new paragraphs, indentation, and numbering to 
make the rule more readable and accessible. The Department has moved lists of items from 
paragraph form into numbered form to improve ease of access and increase reader 
comprehension. These changes are cosmetic in nature and do not change any regulatory 
requirements. 
3. 
Because bait dealers are exempt from the permit process, the Department needed a method to 
identify them more quickly and simply. Thus, the Department created a system by which bait 
dealers could register with the Department as a “bait dealer” and avoid any confusion with regard 
to whether they did or did not meet the exemption status for permitting. 
4. 
The Department created a new “Non-Compliance” section and moved already-existing language 
into that section, illustrating its stand-alone application. 
5. 
These revisions incorporate changes as a result of the Department’s Regulatory Efficiency 
Review Process conducted in accordance with the Governor’s Executive Order D 2012-002.
